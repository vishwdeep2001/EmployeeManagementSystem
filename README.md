Employee Management System
Overview
The Employee Management System is a web-based application built using Spring MVC that allows organizations to manage their employee records efficiently. This system includes frontend validation to ensure accurate and consistent data entry when adding or updating employee information.


Features
Employee Management: Add, view, update, and delete employee records.
Frontend Validation: Form validation to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
Search and Filter: Search and filter employee records based on various criteria.


Technologies Used
Spring MVC: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and managing employee data.
Hibernate: ORM tool for database interaction.
Spring Security: Handling authentication and authorization.
Thymeleaf: Server-side templating engine for rendering views.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend technologies for the user interface and validation.
MySQL (or your preferred database): Database for storing employee records.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vishwdeep2001/EmployeeManagementSystem.git
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in src/main/resources/application.properties.
Build and Run: Create database CrudApp

Build the project using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).
Run the application using a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).
Access the Application:

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (or the appropriate port) to access the Employee Management System.
Frontend Validation
Frontend validation is implemented using JavaScript and ensures that the user inputs are valid before submitting the forms. This includes checking for required fields, validating email addresses, and verifying that numeric fields contain valid numbers. You can find the validation logic in the frontend codebase.
